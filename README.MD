## Introduction

I used python and its libraries to wrangle (gather, assess, and clean) and perform 
exploratory data analysis EDA on a dataset from the tweet archive of Twitter 
user @dog_rates with an account that rate peopleâ€™s dogs. The user also 
known as WeRateDogs which have over 4 million followers and have received 
international media coverage is a good option for learning wrangling and 
visualization of data. The dataset are scattered around, have quality issues and 
likewise tidiness issues. I gathered the data by downloading dataset 
programmatically and querying twitter API, so you can never go wrong 
practicing your wrangling skills on such dataset.

After I used json, requests, and tweepy libraries to gather data from different sources. 
Pandas and Matplotlib libraries were used extensively in assessing, cleaning, and 
exploring the dataset. Please, check act_report and wrangle_report files (doc/pdf)
for further information and insights.
